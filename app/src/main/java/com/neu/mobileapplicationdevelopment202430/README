Architecture

Repository Pattern: For data handling and API communication
Flow: For reactive data streams
Room Database: For local data persistence
ViewModel: For UI state management
Navigation Component: For fragment navigation

Retrofit: For API communication
Room: For database storage
Navigation Component: For navigation between fragments
Coroutines: For asynchronous operations
Flow: For reactive programming


API Handling

The application handles three API scenarios:
Successful API call with data
Successful API call with no data
API call failure

In case of API failure, the app attempts to:
Fetch data from local database
Use fallback JSON file from assets
Show appropriate error message

Fully implemented assignment 4 features, got rid of the sort method since piazza
said it was optional.
